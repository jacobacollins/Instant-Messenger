Instant Messenger application project from textbook that
helps with practicing GUIs, listeners, and Dialog Windows

This program presents the user with a window that has a list of friends 
from which you can either send a message to one or to all. To send a message
to all you would double click a name and it will present the user with a dialog window.
Each message as well as the friends who recieve it are printed on the command line.
